/* Write a Solidity smart contract called SimpleWallet that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. The contract should:

Allow users to deposit ETH into the contract.
Allow users to withdraw ETH they have deposited.
Provide a function to check their balance.
Ensure that users can only withdraw their own deposited ETH.
Deploy and test it on a testnet (like Sepolia or Goerli).
Let me know if you need hints! ðŸš€ */
